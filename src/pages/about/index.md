### What is the F1 In Schools™
The F1 in Schools STEM Challenge is the world’s most prominent student competition for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
Yearly over 20 million students in 17,000 schools take on the challenge of developing the world’s fastest miniature F1 car. Students aged 9 to 19 compete while learning the fundamentals of engineering and enterprise. This includes teamwork, design and planning, manufacturing and testing. Winners of the F1 In Schools have later won prestigious awards like the Australian Engineering Excellence Awards. 

### What is Auxilium?
Auxilium Racing is an F1 In Schools States team. Our team strongly advocates for the betterment of our community. In part, we do this by partnering with like-minded organisations. We also host events for our community to engage and partake, and present to local communities. 


### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
