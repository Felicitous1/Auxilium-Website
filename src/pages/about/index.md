### What is the F1 In Schools™?
The F1 in Schools STEM Challenge is the world's most prominent student competition for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
Yearly over 20 million students in 17,000 schools take on the challenge of developing the world's fastest miniature F1 car. Students aged 9 to 19 compete while learning the fundamentals of engineering and enterprise. This includes teamwork, design and planning, manufacturing and testing. Winners of the F1 In Schools have later won prestigious awards like the Australian Engineering Excellence Awards.
