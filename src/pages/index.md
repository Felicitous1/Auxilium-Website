    If you’re a business less in need of support and would like to associate your brand with STEM in the youth and a community mindset, then you’re in luck! Sponsoring us allows you to help us help our community, and allows you to associate yourself with that. When you sponsor us, we will promote your business on countless avenues and platforms to be sure that it’s seen. Depending on your level, we may even showcase you in our large community events!
